# Murder Mysteries #

How much do you know about infamous murders and the crimes they committed? Solve these murder trivia questions before the time runs out! :mag:

## What this project does ## 

This project contains trivia questions in a simple `object` and a separate object for the game `timer`. This project makes use of `jQuery` to manipulate the `DOM` (to display questions, answers, and the endgame scorecard). User input is collected with `on-click functions`.

## How users can get started with this project ## 

### How to Play: ###

1. **[Start the game](https://fkakatie.github.io/trivia-game/)**.
    - Press the "Start Investigation" button to get your first trivia question.

2. **Select your answer before time runs out**.
    - Under each question, three possible answers will appear. Make your guess before the 15-second timer in the top-right runs out.

3. **Answer all the questions**.
    - After you make a guess or run out of time, you'll be presented with an additional bonus fact before the next question is posed.
    
4. **Check your score**.
    - Your game scores will appear after you've answered all questions. How did you do?
    
4. **Play again**!
    - Reopen your investigation and play again, as many times as you'd like.
